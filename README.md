# 30 Days of Python — Rafiki 

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python journey**, inspired by **BoJack Horseman**, **gaming**, and my personal interests. This notebook takes you step-by-step from Python basics to more advanced concepts, with each "Day" like a mini-chapter in an epic tale.

## Overview

This project is designed to teach Python **from scratch** while keeping it fun and relatable. Each lesson includes:

* **Markdown explanations** for concepts
* **Personalized examples** using my favorite themes: BoJack Horseman, FC26, gaming, anime, and my studies
* **Small Python exercises** for hands-on practice

By the end of 30 days, you'll have:

* Learned Python basics: variables, data types, loops, conditionals
* Explored advanced concepts: functions, modules, file I/O, classes, and inheritance
* Built small simulations reflecting my personal life and interests

## Contents

* **Day 1–5:** Hello World, Variables, Arithmetic, Strings, Lists
* **Day 6–10:** Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Conditionals, Loops
* **Day 11–15:** Comprehensions, Functions, Modules, File I/O, Exceptions
* **Day 16–20:** Boolean Logic, Loops + Conditionals, Nested Data, Random Module, String Formatting
* **Day 21–25:** Slicing & Indexing, Functions, Lambda, Map & Filter, Zip & Enumerate
* **Day 26–30:** Comprehensions + Conditionals, Time Module, Classes & Objects, Inheritance, Final Project Simulation

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**, or **Google Colab**.
2. Follow along **day by day**. Each day includes explanations and code examples.
3. Run the Python code cells to see outputs.
4. Modify the code to make it **even more personalized** — your own games, quotes, or life simulations.

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Optional: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for interactive experience

No additional libraries are required, except:

```bash
import math
import random
import time
```

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

* Understand Python syntax and core concepts
* Use variables, loops, and conditionals effectively
* Create and manipulate data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
* Write functions, handle exceptions, and work with modules
* Understand classes, objects, and inheritance
* Build small simulations integrating Python knowledge

---

## Personalized Touch

This notebook reflects **my life, hobbies, and interests**:

* FC26 gaming sessions
* BoJack Horseman moods and quotes
* Anime watchlist examples
* Study schedules and subject tracking

I can also **create the actual `README.md` file** for you in `.md` format so you can include it in your GitHub repo.

Do you want me to do that next?
